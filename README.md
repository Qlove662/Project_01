## Client Request

A client reached out to me to create an informational website tailored to her business and 
clients. The client is a cook, blogger, and social influence. The website is to contain recipes
(smoothies, salads, juices, meal plans, and etc.)


## User stories

As a user I want to find healthy recipes.
As a user I want to be able to contact the content creator and sign up for email alerts.
As a user I want to be to follow the content creator on social media.
As a user I want to be able to access the website on all my devices

## Typical mistakes when writing user stories

1. Using technical terms that imply a certain way of implementation (e.g. button click, website browsing, submitting an online form). User stories are meant to be written without developer jargon. Reason: maybe the user's pain points or desires can be addressed offline.
2. Writing "As a User" without specifying what kind of user. Very common problem, many product managers mess this up. Select a well described user persona instead.
